        <p>Hi! My name is Oscar Fonseca and I'm from Bogota, Colombia. I enjoy play ping pong and doing gym, and sometimes play fencing. I currently studying Web Desing and Development at BYU Idaho. I'm exited to learn more and practice to get more experience
            and develop better projects! I'm looking forward to creating my own website and learning more about the industry and have my own projects. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me.</p>
