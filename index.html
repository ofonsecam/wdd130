        <p>Hi! My name is Oscar Fonseca and I'm from Bogota, Colombia. I enjoy playing ping pong and going to the gym,
            and sometimes I practice fencing. I am currently studying Web Design and Development at BYU-Idaho. I'm
            excited to learn more and practice
            to get more experience and develop better projects! I'm looking forward to creating my own website, learning
            more about the industry, and having my own projects. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me.
        </p>
